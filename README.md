# ILGPU-Test
 Demoprogramm for MatrixFFN with ILGPU

## 1.first thoughts

My longtime interest in artificial neural networks is there from the 90s when i did study computer science with this topic as focus theme. While having tried any tool i could get my hands on ( free/professional ) i was never pleased - regression is still an uncharted area today.

With C# life is better and you will see that it is possible to even approximate the **parabel**.

This demo program will show you the <u>MatrixFFN-DLL</u>. It includes a feed forward network "<u>FFN</u>" and its own window where you can train a network, input its n-hidden layers and see the results.

ILGPU is a big promise for C# and the *FFN* is there as *FFN_ILGPU*. Feel free to compare the power of both networks with the **parabel** or any data you like.
